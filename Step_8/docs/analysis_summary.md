# Step 8: Decomposition & Profiling Analysis

## Overview
This analysis breaks down the Community Risk Index into its component parts to understand:
1. How different pillars contribute to the final scores
2. What characterizes high and low risk communities
3. How the pillars relate to each other and the final index

## Key Findings

### Pillar Contributions
- See `figures/pillar_contributions.png` for a visualization of how each pillar contributes to community scores
- The stacked bar chart shows the relative importance of each domain in determining overall risk

### Community Profiles
- Static radar plots (`figures/radar_top5.png` and `figures/radar_bottom5.png`) show detailed indicator profiles
- These visualizations reveal patterns in how indicators cluster in high and low risk communities

### Correlation Analysis
- The correlation heatmap (`figures/pillar_correlations.png`) shows relationships between pillars
- All pillars show significant correlation with the final CCRI, validating our theoretical framework

### Theoretical Implications
1. **Social Disorganization Theory**
   - The analysis confirms the interplay between demographic, economic, and housing factors
   - Communities with higher risk show patterns consistent with theory predictions

2. **Routine Activity Theory**
   - The profiles of high and low risk communities align with theoretical expectations
   - Physical environment and guardianship indicators show expected relationships with crime

## Conclusion
This decomposition analysis strengthens our theoretical framework by:
- Validating the relationship between pillars
- Demonstrating how different factors combine to create community risk
- Providing empirical support for our theoretical foundations
