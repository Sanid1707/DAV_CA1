# Step 8: Visualization Guide

This document explains each visualization created in Step 8 and how to interpret them in the context of our theoretical framework.

## 1. Pillar Contributions Chart (pillar_contributions.png)

### What it Shows
- Each bar represents one community
- The height of each colored section shows how much each pillar contributes to the final risk score
- Communities are ordered from highest to lowest total risk score

### How to Interpret
- Taller bars indicate higher overall risk
- The relative size of each color shows which factors are driving risk in each community
- Look for patterns like:
  - Communities where one pillar dominates
  - Communities with balanced contributions from all pillars
  - Clusters of similar contribution patterns

### Theoretical Relevance
- Demonstrates how Social Disorganization Theory's multiple factors combine
- Shows whether communities have concentrated disadvantage in specific areas
- Helps identify if certain pillars consistently drive risk across communities

## 2. Radar Plots (radar_top5.png & radar_bottom5.png)

### What it Shows
- Each line represents one community
- Each spoke represents one indicator
- Values closer to the center indicate higher risk
- Values closer to the edge indicate lower risk

### How to Interpret
- Compare the shapes between high and low risk communities
- Look for:
  - Which indicators consistently differ between high/low risk communities
  - Patterns of indicator clusters within pillars
  - Unusual patterns or outliers

### Theoretical Relevance
- Shows how indicators within pillars relate to each other
- Demonstrates patterns predicted by criminological theories
- Helps identify protective factors in low-risk communities

## 3. Correlation Heatmap (pillar_correlations.png)

### What it Shows
- The strength and direction of relationships between pillars and final scores
- Red colors indicate positive correlations
- Blue colors indicate negative correlations
- Darker colors indicate stronger relationships

### How to Interpret
- Look for:
  - Strong correlations between pillars
  - Which pillars most strongly correlate with final scores
  - Unexpected relationships that merit further investigation

### Theoretical Relevance
- Validates relationships predicted by theory
- Shows how different aspects of community risk interact
- Helps identify potential causal pathways

## Key Findings

1. **Pillar Interactions**
   - How Demographics and Income pillars relate
   - The role of Housing conditions in moderating risk
   - Crime patterns' relationship with other pillars

2. **Risk Patterns**
   - Characteristic profiles of high-risk communities
   - Protective factors in low-risk communities
   - Common combinations of risk factors

3. **Theoretical Support**
   - Evidence for Social Disorganization Theory mechanisms
   - Support for Routine Activity Theory predictions
   - Identification of key intervention points

## Using These Visualizations

These visualizations serve multiple purposes:
1. Validating our theoretical framework
2. Identifying patterns and relationships
3. Supporting policy recommendations
4. Communicating findings to stakeholders

They provide empirical support for our theoretical approach while highlighting specific areas where interventions might be most effective.
