## PCA Visualizations

### Scree Plots

**File Location:** `Step_4/output/figures/pca_scree_{pillar}.png`

**Description:** 
These plots display two key aspects of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for each pillar:
- Left panel: Bar chart showing eigenvalues for each principal component
- Right panel: Line chart showing cumulative explained variance

**Key Features:**
- Red horizontal line in left panel at y=1 represents the Kaiser criterion threshold
- Red horizontal line in right panel at y=0.6 represents the 60% cumulative variance threshold

**Interpretation:**
- Components with eigenvalues > 1 (above red line in left panel) are typically considered significant according to the Kaiser criterion
- The "elbow" in the scree plot (left panel) indicates where additional components contribute minimally to variance explanation
- The cumulative variance plot (right panel) shows how many components are needed to reach the 60% variance threshold

**Conclusions:**
- For Demographics pillar: 3 components are retained, explaining approximately 72% of variance
- For Income pillar: 1 component is retained, explaining approximately 71% of variance
- For Housing pillar: 5 components are retained, explaining approximately 77% of variance
- For Crime pillar: 3 components are retained, explaining approximately 77% of variance

### Component Loadings

**File Location:** `Step_4/output/figures/pca_loadings_{pillar}.png`

**Description:**
Heatmaps showing how strongly each original variable correlates with each retained principal component.

**Key Features:**
- Color scale ranges from blue (negative correlation) to red (positive correlation)
- Variables are sorted by the absolute magnitude of loading on the first component
- Numeric values represent the correlation coefficient between variable and component

**Interpretation:**
- Strong positive loadings (dark red) indicate variables that increase as the component increases
- Strong negative loadings (dark blue) indicate variables that decrease as the component increases
- Variables with strong loadings (either positive or negative) are most influential for that component

**Conclusions:**
- Demographics PC1 is strongly associated with immigration variables
- Income PC1 represents economic well-being (positively with income, negatively with poverty)
- Housing PC1 captures housing density and quality
- Crime PC1 represents overall crime rates (all crime variables load positively)

### Component Interpretation

**File Location:** `Step_4/output/figures/pca_interpretation_{pillar}.png`

**Description:**
Horizontal bar charts showing variable loadings for each retained principal component.

**Key Features:**
- Blue bars represent positive loadings
- Red bars represent negative loadings
- Variables are sorted by absolute loading magnitude

**Interpretation:**
- These charts help name and interpret what each component represents
- Variables at the top of each chart have the strongest relationship with that component

**Conclusions:**
- Demographics PC1: "Immigration and Diversity" component
- Demographics PC2: "Racial Composition" component
- Demographics PC3: "Urban Population" component
- Income PC1: "Economic Prosperity vs. Poverty" component
- Housing PC1-PC5: Various aspects of housing conditions, density, and stability
- Crime PC1: "Overall Crime Rate" component
- Crime PC2-PC3: Specific crime type patterns

## Clustering Visualizations

### Dendrograms

**Description:**
Hierarchical clustering tree diagrams showing how communities are grouped based on similarity.

**Key Features:**
- Vertical axis represents the distance/dissimilarity between clusters
- Horizontal axis represents communities (truncated to fit)
- Branch points represent where clusters merge

**Interpretation:**
- The height of each branch point indicates how dissimilar the merged clusters are
- Lower merges indicate more similar communities
- Cutting the tree horizontally at different heights produces different numbers of clusters

**Conclusions:**
- The optimal cut point is determined by the silhouette analysis
- Natural groupings of communities are visible in the structure
- Demographics shows 3 distinct clusters
- Income shows 2 main clusters
- Housing shows 2 main clusters with substructures
- Crime shows 2 distinct clusters

### Silhouette Score Plots

**File Location:** `Step_4/output/figures/silhouette_scores_{pillar}.png`

**Description:**
Line charts showing silhouette scores for different numbers of clusters (2-10).

**Key Features:**
- Horizontal axis represents the number of clusters (k)
- Vertical axis represents the silhouette score (measure of cluster quality)
- Higher silhouette scores indicate better-defined clusters

**Interpretation:**
- The optimal number of clusters is where the silhouette score peaks
- Higher scores (closer to 1) indicate clear, well-separated clusters
- Lower scores (closer to 0) indicate overlapping or poorly defined clusters

**Conclusions:**
- Demographics: 3 clusters optimal (score ≈ 0.42)
- Income: 2 clusters optimal (score ≈ 0.60)
- Housing: 2 clusters optimal (score ≈ 0.28)
- Crime: 2 clusters optimal (score ≈ 0.45)
- The relatively high silhouette scores for Income and Crime indicate well-defined clusters
- The lower score for Housing suggests more overlap between clusters

### Cluster Visualizations

**File Location:** `Step_4/output/figures/clusters_visualization_{pillar}.png`

**Description:**
Scatter plots showing communities in the space of the first two principal components, colored by cluster assignment.

**Key Features:**
- Left panel: Hierarchical clustering results
- Right panel: K-means clustering results
- Points represent communities
- Colors represent cluster membership
- Axes represent the first two principal components

**Interpretation:**
- Communities close together in this space are similar
- Distinct color regions indicate well-separated clusters
- The comparison between hierarchical and k-means shows the consistency of clustering methods

**Conclusions:**
- Demographics: Shows clear separation of 3 clusters along both PC dimensions
- Income: Shows clear separation of 2 clusters primarily along PC1
- Housing: Shows more overlap between clusters
- Crime: Shows 2 clusters with moderate separation
- The similarity between hierarchical and k-means results validates the cluster structure

## Cluster Profiling Visualizations

### Cluster Box Plots

**File Location:** `Step_4/output/figures/{pillar}_cluster_boxplots.png`

**Description:**
Box plots showing the distribution of original indicator values within each cluster.

**Key Features:**
- Each subplot represents one original variable
- Horizontal axis represents clusters
- Vertical axis represents variable values
- Box shows IQR (interquartile range), whiskers show range, line shows median

**Interpretation:**
- Differences in box heights between clusters indicate how that variable distinguishes clusters
- Overlapping boxes suggest the variable doesn't strongly differentiate clusters
- Box width indicates number of communities in that cluster

**Conclusions:**
- Demographics: Clusters differ strongly in racial composition and immigration measures
- Income: Clusters are primarily separated by income levels and poverty rates
- Housing: Housing occupancy and stability are key differentiators
- Crime: Crime rate variables consistently higher in one cluster than the other

### Cluster Radar Plots

**Key Features:**
- Each axis represents one variable (normalized scale)
- Each colored polygon represents one cluster
- Distance from center indicates variable value (higher = larger value)

**Interpretation:**
- The shape of each polygon reveals the "signature" of the cluster
- Differences in shape indicate how clusters differ in their overall profiles
- Areas where polygons diverge most show the strongest differentiating variables

**Conclusions:**
- Demographics: Cluster profiles show distinct patterns of ethnic composition and urbanization
- Income: Clear differentiation between high vs. low economic prosperity clusters
- Housing: Differences in housing density, quality, and stability between clusters

- Horizontal axis lists indicators
- Indicators that cluster together early (lower height) are more highly correlated

**Interpretation:**
- Indicators merging at low heights have strong correlations
- The red vertical line at x=0.5 represents a correlation threshold of |r|=0.5
- Clusters of variables below this line may contain redundant information

**Conclusions:**
- Demographics: Some correlation between race/ethnicity variables, but moderate overall
- Income: Strong correlation between poverty and public assistance indicators
- Housing: Several groups of highly correlated housing indicators
- Crime: Strong correlations between related crime measures (e.g., counts and per capita rates)
