    Number of components to keep for Demographics pillar: 3
    
    Rationale:
    - Kaiser criterion (eigenvalue > 1): 3 component(s)
    - 60% cumulative variance criterion: 3 component(s)
    - Scree plot elbow: visual inspection shows an elbow at component 4
    - Conceptual interpretability: The retained components can be interpreted as follows:
    
    PC1 (37.5% variance): Positively influenced by PctRecentImmig, PctNotSpeakEnglWell, racePctHisp; 
    PC2 (20.2% variance): Positively influenced by racepctblack; Negatively influenced by racePctWhite, racePctAsian
    PC3 (13.9% variance): Positively influenced by PctNotSpeakEnglWell; Negatively influenced by pctUrban, population
