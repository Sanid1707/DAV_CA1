# Compensability in the Community Risk Index

## What is Compensability?

In the context of composite indicators, **compensability** refers to the extent to which a deficit in one component can be offset by a surplus in another. The Community Risk Index uses a linear aggregation method (weighted arithmetic mean), which allows for **partial compensability** between indicators and pillars.

## Types of Compensability

There are three main approaches to compensability in composite indicators:

1. **Full compensability**: A deficit in one indicator can be fully compensated by a surplus in another (arithmetic mean)
2. **Partial compensability**: A deficit in one indicator can be partially offset by a surplus in another (weighted arithmetic mean)
3. **Non-compensability**: No compensation is allowed between indicators (geometric mean or non-compensatory multi-criteria methods)

## Compensability in Our Methodology

### Within Pillars

Within each pillar of the Community Risk Index, we use a linear weighted mean, which allows for partial compensability between indicators. This means:

- In the **Demographics pillar**, strong performance in one demographic indicator (e.g., lower racial segregation) can partially offset weaknesses in another (e.g., higher percentage not speaking English well).
- In the **Income pillar**, better performance in median income can partially compensate for weaker performance in public assistance rates.
- In the **Housing pillar**, high occupancy rates and residential stability can help offset disadvantages in other housing indicators.
- In the **Crime pillar**, lower rates of one crime type can partially compensate for higher rates of another.

### Between Pillars

At the cross-pillar level, our linear aggregation also allows partial compensability:

- Strong demographic integration may partially offset economic disadvantages
- Strong housing circumstances may partially compensate for crime vulnerabilities
- Strong economic conditions may partially offset demographic challenges

## Theoretical Justification for Compensability

The partial compensability approach aligns with criminological theory in several ways:

1. **Protective Factor Framework**: Criminological research suggests that protective factors in one domain can reduce the impact of risk factors in another domain. For example, strong family structures (Housing pillar) can mitigate the effects of economic disadvantage (Income pillar).

2. **Social Disorganization Theory**: Shaw and McKay identified multiple pathways to community disorganization, with strengths in some areas potentially offsetting weaknesses in others.

3. **Routine Activity Theory**: Cohen and Felson's theory suggests that crime requires the convergence of three elements: motivated offenders, suitable targets, and absence of capable guardians. Strengths in reducing one element (e.g., improving guardianship through community cohesion) can partially offset weaknesses in another (e.g., economic vulnerabilities creating motivated offenders).

## Example: How Compensability Works in Practice

Consider two hypothetical communities:

**Community A**:
- Demographics score: 0.8 (strong)
- Income score: 0.3 (weak)
- Housing score: 0.7 (strong)
- Crime score: 0.6 (moderate)

**Community B**:
- Demographics score: 0.5 (moderate)
- Income score: 0.5 (moderate)
- Housing score: 0.5 (moderate)
- Crime score: 0.5 (moderate)

Using equal weights (0.25 for each pillar), both communities would receive the same overall score of 0.6. This illustrates how our approach allows for compensability - Community A's strengths in Demographics and Housing partially offset its weakness in Income, resulting in an equivalent overall risk level to Community B, which has moderate performance across all domains.

## Limitations of Our Compensability Approach

While partial compensability is theoretically justified, it has limitations that should be acknowledged:

1. **Critical thresholds**: In some cases, indicators may have critical thresholds below which no amount of compensation from other indicators is meaningful. Our approach does not account for such thresholds.

2. **Interaction effects**: Some indicators may interact in ways that are not captured by linear aggregation. For example, the combination of high poverty and high residential instability may have multiplicative rather than additive effects.

3. **Stakeholder perspectives**: Different stakeholders may have different views on whether and how much compensability should be allowed between different aspects of community risk.

## Addressing Limitations through Multiple Weighting Scenarios

To address these limitations, we provide multiple weighting scenarios that give different emphasis to the four pillars:

1. **Equal Weights**: Treats all pillars as equally important, with full compensability between them
2. **PCA Weights**: Uses data-driven weights based on statistical relationships
3. **Stakeholder Weights**: Reflects priorities of different stakeholders with varying degrees of compensability between pillars

This multi-scenario approach provides a more nuanced view of community risk that acknowledges different perspectives on compensability.

## Conclusion

The partial compensability allowed by our linear aggregation method is theoretically justified by criminological research and provides a balanced approach to assessing community risk. By acknowledging that strengths in some areas can partially offset weaknesses in others, our Community Risk Index captures the complex, multidimensional nature of crime risk factors in communities.
