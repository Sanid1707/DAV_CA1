# Step 6: Weighting & Aggregation Summary Report

## Executive Summary

Step 6 successfully implemented the weighting and aggregation methodology for the Community Risk Index (CRI), following the OECD/JRC Handbook guidelines. This step transformed normalized indicators into meaningful pillar scores and a final composite index. Multiple weighting approaches were applied, correlation checks were conducted to avoid double-counting, and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess robustness.

## Key Achievements

1. **Theoretically Grounded Framework**: The weighting decisions were anchored in criminological theory, particularly Social Disorganization Theory and Routine Activity Theory.

2. **Data-Driven & Expert-Based Approaches**: Three distinct weighting scenarios were developed, combining statistical evidence (PCA weights) with equal weighting and stakeholder perspectives.

3. **Comprehensive Visualization**: Generated insightful visualizations showing community rankings, pillar score patterns, and sensitivity to methodological choices.

4. **Well-Documented Methodology**: Thorough documentation of all methodological choices and their justifications was provided.

## Detailed Process

### 1. Within-Pillar Weighting

For each theoretical pillar:

- **Demographics Pillar**: Applied PCA-variance weights to balance diverse demographic indicators.
- **Income Pillar**: Used PCA-variance weights to address the multifaceted nature of economic disadvantage.
- **Housing Pillar**: Employed PCA-variance weights to capture multiple dimensions of housing conditions.
- **Crime Pillar**: Applied equal weights to ensure balanced representation of all crime types.

### 2. Double-Counting Assessment

- Correlation matrices were produced for each pillar.
- Highly correlated indicator pairs (|r| > 0.9) were identified.
- Weights were adjusted where necessary to prevent redundancy.

### 3. Aggregation Method

A linear weighted mean was used for aggregation:
- ùëÉ‚±º = ‚àë·µ¢(ùë§·µ¢ √ó ùêº·µ¢) for pillar scores
- ùê∂ùëÖùêº = ‚àë‚±º(ùë§‚±º √ó ùëÉ‚±º) for the composite index

This approach allows for partial compensability, reflecting the theoretical understanding that community strengths can partially offset weaknesses.

### 4. Cross-Pillar Weighting Scenarios

Three alternative weighting schemes were developed:

1. **Equal Weights (0.25 each)**: Based on the principle that all four domains are equally important for understanding community risk.

2. **PCA-Variance Weights**: Data-driven weights where Demographics (0.61) and Income (0.28) received higher weights than Housing (0.08) and Crime (0.03).

3. **Stakeholder Allocation**: Hypothetical stakeholder priorities with Income and Crime (0.30 each) weighted higher than Demographics and Housing (0.20 each).

### 5. Sensitivity Analysis

- Ranking differences between weighting scenarios were calculated.
- Communities with the largest rank shifts were identified.
- Visualizations were created to illustrate these differences.

## Key Findings

1. **Highest Performing Communities**: Communities with high scores across all pillars consistently ranked highest regardless of weighting scheme. These typically featured strong economic conditions, stable housing, low crime rates, and balanced demographics.

2. **Scenario Sensitivity**: Some communities showed significant rank shifts (up to 200 positions) between scenarios, particularly when strong performance in Demographics/Income contrasted with weaker performance in Housing/Crime or vice versa.

3. **Pillar Relationships**: Strong performance in Income and Housing pillars tended to correlate with strong Crime pillar scores, supporting criminological theories linking economic stability and physical environment to crime reduction.

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Compensability Assumptions**: The linear aggregation method assumes partial compensability between indicators and pillars, which may not fully capture threshold effects.

2. **PCA Weight Volatility**: PCA-derived weights can be sensitive to the specific dataset and may change if new data is added.

3. **Hypothetical Stakeholder Weights**: The stakeholder weights are hypothetical and would ideally be derived from actual stakeholder consultations.

## Conclusion

Step 6 successfully transformed normalized indicators into a meaningful Community Risk Index that balances theoretical considerations with empirical relationships. The provision of multiple weighting scenarios enhances the utility of the index for different stakeholders while maintaining methodological rigor. The resulting composite scores provide a comprehensive assessment of community risk factors that can inform policy decisions and resource allocation.

## Next Steps

1. **Validation**: Compare CRI rankings with external measures of community well-being.
2. **Stakeholder Consultation**: Gather input from actual stakeholders to refine the weighting scheme.
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Develop methods to track changes in the CRI over time.
4. **Policy Applications**: Develop targeted policy recommendations based on pillar-specific strengths and weaknesses.
