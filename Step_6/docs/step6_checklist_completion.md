This document confirms that all required items in the Step 6 checklist have been successfully completed.

## Checklist Items Status

| # | Checklist Item | Status | Location/Evidence |

| 3 | Choose a weighting logic within each pillar | ✅ Completed | Step_6/code/weighting_aggregation.py (lines 80-120); Demographics, Income, Housing: PCA; Crime: Equal Weights |
| 4 | Justify that choice | ✅ Completed | Step_6/docs/weighting_aggregation_methodology.md (Section 3) |
| 5 | Check for double-counting inside each pillar | ✅ Completed | Enhanced correlation matrices (Step_6/output/figures/enhanced_corr_*.png) |
| 6 | Adjust weights if needed | ✅ Completed | Step_6/code/weighting_aggregation.py (lines 145-159) |
| 7 | Aggregate indicators → Pillar scores | ✅ Completed | Step_6/output/pillar_scores.csv; Formula implementation in code (lines 161-166) |
| 8 | Select cross-pillar weighting scheme | ✅ Completed | Three scenarios implemented: Equal, PCA, and Stakeholder weights (lines 179-208) |
| 9 | Compute composite Crime-Risk Index | ✅ Completed | Step_6/output/composite_scores.csv |
| 10 | Rank & visualise | ✅ Completed | Enhanced bar chart and radar charts (Step_6/output/figures/) |
| 11 | Mini Sensitivity Test | ✅ Completed | Rank shift plots between different weighting scenarios (improved_rank_shift_*.png) |
| 12 | Quality checks | ✅ Completed | Score range and NaN checks in code (lines 338-347) |

## Visualization Improvements

The following visualizations have been enhanced to better communicate the results:

1. **Correlation Matrices**:
   - Improved individual correlation heatmaps with annotations for highly correlated pairs
   - Combined visualization showing all four pillars' correlation matrices together
   - Clear identification of potential double-counting issues

2. **Radar Charts**:
   - Enhanced radar charts for top and bottom communities
   - Combined top vs. bottom visualization for easy comparison
   - Improved color schemes and labeling

3. **Rank Shift Plots**:
   - Enhanced rank shift visualizations showing communities most affected by weighting choices
   - Clear annotations showing the magnitude of rank shifts
   - Separate visualizations for Equal vs. PCA and Equal vs. Stakeholder comparisons

4. **Bar Charts**:
   - Enhanced top communities bar chart with value labels
   - Improved color gradient for better visual appeal

## Documentation Completeness

All methodological choices have been thoroughly documented:

- Theoretical framework (four pillars)
- Selection of indicators and their normalization
- Weighting approaches and justifications
- Checks for double-counting and adjustments
- Aggregation methods and compensability considerations
- Cross-pillar weighting scenarios
- Quality checks and interpretation guidelines

## Conclusion

Step 6 (Weighting & Aggregation) has been successfully completed according to the requirements in the checklist. All the necessary components have been implemented, including:

- Theoretically grounded weighting choices
- Multiple weighting scenarios
- Careful checks for redundancy and double-counting
- Appropriate aggregation methods
- Comprehensive visualizations
- Thorough documentation

The output of this step is a fully functional Community Risk Index (CRI) that transforms normalized indicators into a meaningful composite score, with transparent methodological choices and robust sensitivity testing.
