# Data Imputation Summary

## Overview
- **Total Variables Processed**: 47
- **Variables with Missing Data**: 0
- **Complete Data Points**: 104105
- **Imputation Approach**: No imputation required
- **Percentage Variables Check**: All confirmed within 0-100 range

## Data Completeness Assessment
- All data points are complete (no missing values)
- No imputation was necessary as the dataset is already complete
- Data from Step 2 was thoroughly cleaned with all missing values properly handled

## Data Types Distribution
```

percentage    21
count         12
ratio         12
identifier     1
monetary       1

## Data Quality Checks
- **Percentage Variables**: All confirmed within 0-100 range post-analysis
- **Count Variables**: All non-negative integers
- **Monetary/Ratio Variables**: All non-negative values
- **Distribution Check**: All variables maintain their expected distributions

## Reliability Assessment
- Since no imputation was needed, there is no uncertainty introduced by imputation
- The dataset represents the original collected data with complete values
- Full transparency in data processing from Step 2 has led to a complete dataset
- Standard deviation (_std) columns have been preserved for Step 7 sensitivity analysis

## Key Findings and Recommendations
- The complete dataset is ready for multivariate analysis
- No additional data processing for missing values is required
- Proceed to multivariate analysis with confidence in data completeness
