# Outlier Handling Checklist

## Summary of Actions Taken

| Action | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Logged/transformed long-tailed variables | ✅ | Log transformation applied to count variables with outliers |
| Capped/trimmed variables that would stretch min-max range | ✅ | Percentage variables capped at 0-100, others winsorized at 1%/99% |
| Updated missing-value flags for trimmed records | ✅ | No values were removed, only transformed or capped |
| Kept untouched copy of raw data | ✅ | Original data preserved as 'original_df' and in '03_preimp_raw.csv' |

## Outlier Handling Approach

The following strategies were applied based on variable type:

- **Percentage Variables**: Clipped at natural bounds (0-100)
- **Ratio Variables**: Winsorization at 1% and 99% percentiles
- **Count Variables**: Log transformation using log(1+x)
- **Monetary Variables**: Robust scaling using (x-median)/MAD

## Impact of Outlier Handling

- 46 variables processed
- 1525 outliers identified across all variables
- 37 variables transformed or scaled
