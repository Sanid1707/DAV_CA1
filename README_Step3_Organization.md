# Step 3 Organization Update

The files related to Step 3 (Data Imputation and Outlier Handling) have been reorganized into a structured directory to improve organization and navigation.

## New Structure

All Step 3 files are now organized in the `Step_3/` directory with the following structure:

```
Step_3/
├── code/                 # Python scripts
├── data/                 # Data files (input, intermediate, and output)
├── output/               # Output files
│   ├── reports/          # Documentation and reports
│   └── visualizations/   # Generated visualizations
│       └── outliers/     # Outlier-specific visualizations
├── README.md             # Detailed documentation of the Step 3 structure
└── get_final_dataset.py  # Helper script to extract the final dataset
```

## Accessing the Final Dataset for Multivariate Analysis

To access the final dataset for Step 4 (Multivariate Analysis), you can:

1. Use the file directly at: `Step_3/data/step3_outlier_handled_dataset.csv`

2. Run the helper script to copy it to the main directory:
   ```
   cd Step_3
   python get_final_dataset.py
   ```
   This will create `step3_final_dataset_for_multivariate.csv` in the main project directory.

## Complete Documentation

For detailed information about the Step 3 files and their organization, please refer to the README file within the Step_3 directory: `Step_3/README.md`

This reorganization follows best practices for data science project structure, making it easier to:
- Navigate between different components
- Understand the process flow
- Locate specific files by their purpose
- Access the final dataset for subsequent analysis steps
